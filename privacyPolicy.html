                To improve the effectiveness and usability of the Portal for our
                Users, we use "cookies", or such similar electronic tools to
                collect information to assign each visitor a unique random
                number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the
                User's individual interests using the identified computer.
                Unless the User voluntarily identifies himself/herself (e.g.,
                through registration), SuperPlay has no way of knowing who the
                User is, even if we assign a cookie to the User's computer. The
                only personal information a cookie can contain is information
                supplied by the User. A cookie cannot read data off the User's
                hard drive. SuperPlay’s advertisers may also assign their own
                cookies to the User's browser (if the User clicks on their ad
                banners), a process that SuperPlay does not control.

                SuperPlay's web servers automatically collect limited
                information about User's computer's connection to the Internet,
                including User's IP address, when the User visits the Portal.
                (User's IP address is a number that lets computers attached to
                the Internet know where to send data to the User -- such as the
                web pages viewed by the User). The User's IP address does not
                identify the User personally. SuperPlay uses this information to
                deliver its web pages to Users upon request, to tailor its
                Portal to the interests of its users, to measure traffic within
                the Portal and let advertisers know the geographic locations
